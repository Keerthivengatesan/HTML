    <p>MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. <br>
        Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. <br>
        Released in February 2009 by 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.), it supports features like sharding, replication, and ACID transactions (from version 4.0).<br>
         MongoDB Atlas, its managed cloud service, operates on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. Current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL). <br>
        MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.</p>
