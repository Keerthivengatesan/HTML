    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.<br>
         Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]

Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.
 These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.</p>
