    <p>The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.<br>
         The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.<br>
          The framework does not impose any specific programming model.[citation needed]. 
        <br>The framework has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model.</p>
